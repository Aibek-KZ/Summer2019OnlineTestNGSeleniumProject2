HTML frames allow developers to present documents in multiple views, which may be in a separate child window or sub-window.
Multiple views offer developers a way to keep certain information visible while other views are scrolled or replaced.
For example, within the same window, one frame might display a static banner, the second a navigation menu, and the third the main document that can be scrolled through or replaced by navigating in the second frame.
A page with frames is created using the <frameset> tag or the <iframe> tag.
Developers can embed external documents or documents from another domain using the <iframe> tag, also known as inline frames. Various social media websites provide buttons that can be embedded in your web applications to link to these websites.
